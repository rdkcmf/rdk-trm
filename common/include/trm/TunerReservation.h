/**
 * @defgroup TRM_RESERVATION Tuner Reservation
 * @ingroup TRM_MAIN
 * @par Tuner Reservation
 * The TunerReservation object represents a requested or granted tuner reservation.
 * The reservation has a validity window that is indicated by startTime and duration.
 * The requesting device is required to renew a reservation before its validity window disappears.
 * If it is not renewed, the token will be released by TRM and all messages that follow bearing the
 * token will be considered as MalformedRequest . For Record reservations, the requested startTime
 * should be N seconds ahead of the actual recording start time
 * (or should be left out so that the granted reservation starts at the time when it is granted by TRM),
 * to give room in case a conflict needs to be resolved.
 * @n @n
 * A same reservationToken can be reused if and only if values of {device, activity} are the same.
 * In the case, the {serviceLocator, startTime, duration} of the reused token can be updated.
 * This is useful during a channel change, where the TRM client can reuse a same Live tuner reservation by
 * just updating the serviceLocator of it.
 * @n @n
 * A reservation is renewed by requesting tunerRreservation with a same reservationToken.
 * @n
 * @code
 * TunerReservation :=
 * {
 *     "reservationToken" (optional) : [String] reservationToken,
 *     "device"                      : [String] device,
 *     "serviceLocator"              : [String] sourceLocator,
 *     "startTime" (optional)        : [long] startTime,
 *     "duration" (optional)         : [long] duration
 *     "activity"                    : <Activity>
 *     "customAttributes" (optional) : <CustomAttributes>
 * }
 * @endcode
 * @n
 * - @b token: a unique token generated when a reservation is created.
 * After a reservation is created, this token is used in all messages to uniquely identify an existing reservation within TRM.
 * - @b device: the remote device requesting the reservation. For a hot recording, this
 * should be the receiverId of the originating device.
 * - @b serviceLocator: locator of the service that the tuner will tune to.
 * - @b startTime:start time of the reservation in milliseconds from the epoch. If not present in a request message,
 * this is set to when the reservation is granted or renewed. startTime is always included in a response message.
 * - @b duration: the reservation period measured from the start in milliseconds.
 *  If not present in a request message, the token is valid for a default duration. duration is always included in a response message.
 * - @b activity: the granted activity. Granted activity may or may not be the same as the requested.
 * In the latter case the owner of the reservation will need to comply with the returned activity,
 * or initiate conflict resolution.
 * @n
 * For example, when a client requests Live activity when EAS is in progress,
 * the returned reservation will have the EAS activity.
 * - @b customAttributes: a set of attributes assigned by the application.
 * These attributes are associated with the reservation token for the lifetime of the reservation.
 *
 * @par Response Status
 * All response messages from TRM will provide information regarding the status of the response.
 * Responses to recognized requests may contain additional information, as described in later sections of this document.
 * Responses to unrecognized requests will contain only this status data, consisting of a status code
 * and message signifying the request was unrecognized.
 * @n @n
 * @code
 * ResponseStatus := {
 *    "status"                   : [String] status,
 *    "statusMessage" [optional] : [String] statusMessage
 * }
 * @endcode
 * @n
 * Where the fields are defined as follows:
 * @n @b status: is an enumeration of strings indicating the status of the request.
 * - @b Ok Request was successful.
 * - @b GeneralError Request was unsuccessful.
 * - @b MalFormedRequest Unexpected/Invalid request data.
 * - @b UnRecognizedRequest Unrecognized request.
 * - @b InsufficientResource: there is no tuner available.
 * - @b UserCancellation: Token is released as result of user cancellation.
 * - @b InvalidToken: Token included in the message is invalid.
 * - @b InvalidState: Token is in invalid state.
 * - @b statusMessage: is a string containing additional information about the status.
